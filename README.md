Hack BTC Change Address example
There is a scam circulating on the internet, where 
a "virus" automatically detects a 
BITCOIN wallet in your WINDOWS transfer area, 
and CHANGES the copied BITCOIN address to a hacker's 
BITCOIN address in which you can confuse yourself and to 
make a wrong transfer :(

Do the test yourself:

1 - Open the program.
2- Copy a BTC address with CTRL + C.
3- And paste the address anywhere.

Okay, you'll see that the address has changed :(
